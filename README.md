üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement
Exercise 1
Create an object hierarchy with three classes: Worker, OnlineWorker, and InPersonWorker.

The Worker class has the attributes name, surname, and pricePerHour. It includes a method calculateSalary() which takes the number of hours worked as a parameter and multiplies it by the hourly price. The child classes should override this method using @Override.

In the Main() method of the Main class, invoke the necessary methods to demonstrate the functionality of the @Override annotation.

For InPersonWorker, the calculateSalary() method will receive the number of hours worked in a month as a parameter. The salary is calculated by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly price, plus a static attribute gasoline that is added to this class.

For OnlineWorker, the calculateSalary() method will receive the number of hours worked in a month as a parameter. The salary is calculated by multiplying the hours worked by the hourly price, plus the flat rate of the Internet plan, which is a constant in the OnlineWorker class.

Exercise 2
Add some deprecated methods to the child classes and use the @Deprecated annotation. Invoke these deprecated methods from an external class and suppress the "deprecated" warnings using the corresponding annotation.
